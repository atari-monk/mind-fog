# Coding Reflection 2025  

## Mindset Shift  

Instead of seeing projects as something to "finish," approach them like a growing plant.  
Think of it as cultivating a garden—nurture your projects, prune when needed, and let them develop naturally.  
Just like healthy plants, projects go through different stages: growing, blooming, producing results, and eventually fading.  
By adopting this mindset, you can categorize projects based on their stage of growth.  

## Project Categories  

Projects fall into three main groups:  

- **code** – Active projects you're currently working on (usually 3-5 at a time).  
- **code_product** – Completed projects that provide value and are considered finished.  
- **code_archive** – Experimental or inactive projects that are stored for potential future use.  

The ultimate goal is to transition most projects into **code_product** status.  

## Gamification  

The idea is to code for a set amount of time and, as a "reward," receive an equal amount of pure playtime.  
Another aspect of this approach is to make coding itself feel like a game.
