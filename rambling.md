# **Rambling**

- I miss human touch.  
  Unfortunately, I can't stand humans and dating apps.  

- Women can feel like a trap.  

- Job market, currencies, society, values, civilization.  
  This can be slavery and prison for most, if not all.  

- Dystopian vision of society.  
  Growth must be stopped.  
  Only a select few can produce.  
  Then there will be a price that can be imposed on everything.  
  Therefore, control.  
  Donâ€™t want to give away control.  
  Cannot allow questioning of values and the story.  
  Want to raise the price all the time.  
  Financial scams, war, prison, consumerism, corporations.  
  Society is kept weak, with strong groups if it benefits the rulers.  

- Society is a machine.  
  A person is a software protocol generated for communication.  
  Yet feelings, experiences, and connections are real at the mind level.  

- Everything in the universe may just be some kind of music.  
  The mind can build logical structures endlessly, but knowledge is always limited.
